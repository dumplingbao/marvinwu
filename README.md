## What is this ?

I am [zettelkasten](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPOI4f7yCag) fan, and I am using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to keep track of everything, it synced to a private git repo was very nice. But it also messy and not organized. 

Inspired by [Simon Willison's Gitscrape process](https://simonwillison.net/2020/Oct/9/git-scraping/), I creatd this repo to :

* import my notes from another private repo of mine.
* clean the notes (mainly fixing the front matters)
* use [zoni/obsidian-export](https://github.com/zoni/obsidian-export) to convert those notes to markdown
* dumped notes to db 
* use SQL to query and group the notes into different topic
* render the README.md every day from the data
