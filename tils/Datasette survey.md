## Interesting things to try

* [Running SQL queries — Datasette documentation](https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/sql_queries.html#cross-database-queries)

* [Facets — Datasette documentation](https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/facets.html)

* [Full-text search — Datasette documentation](https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/full_text_search.html)

* can use this for TIL [markdown-to-sqlite - a tool for Datasette](https://datasette.io/tools/markdown-to-sqlite)


* > Every row in every Datasette table has its own URL. This means individual records can be linked to directly.
