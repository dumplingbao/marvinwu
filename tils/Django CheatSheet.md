### Concepts
* How does migration work in django ?


	there is a table in the db django_migration that keeps the pointer of current migration, and when you do 

	```
	pipenv run python manage.py makemigrations
	pipenv run python manage.py migrate
	```


	it will check the the app migration pointer with the script version, if not matching it will require you to run migration.

	The best practice is when you have schema change and wnat to change env, use production env to run api in local 
* what does the serializers do in dango?

	> The serializers in REST framework work very similarly to Django's Form and ModelForm classes
	> Serializer fields handle converting between primitive values and internal datatypes. They also deal with validating input values, as well as retrieving and setting the values from their parent objects.
	
	ref: [10 things you need to know to effectively use Django Rest Framework | Blog - Profil Software, Python Software House With Heart and Soul, Poland](https://profil-software.com/blog/development/10-things-you-need-know-effectively-use-django-rest-framework/)
	
	> which act as translators between Django model instances and their representations such as json.
* what is query set?
	query set is a collection of the objects the fits your query
	
	access the queryset by model.objects.
	```python
	Snippet.objects.all() -> ORM relationship of the table
	# it returns query set for all objects
	serializer_class = UserSerializer
	for each in queryset:
		print(each.username)

	```
* what's the difference b/w an app and a project?

	project is the monorepo and app is the individual package	
* what's the differenece between session and cookie
	* cookie is usually the id of session, it is used as a key to read server side information
	* cookies are sent automatically
	session is the state
* what is csrf token?
 
	Since we’re creating a POST form (which can have the effect of modifying data), we need to worry about Cross Site Request Forgeries. Thankfully, you don’t have to worry too hard, because Django comes with a helpful system for protecting against it. In short, all POST forms that are targeted at internal URLs should use the {% csrf_token %} template tag.

	> We are using the reverse() function in the HttpResponseRedirect constructor in this example. This function helps avoid having to hardcode a URL in the view function. It is given the name of the view that we want to pass control to and the variable portion of the URL pattern that points to that view. In this case, using the URLconf we set up in Tutorial 3, this reverse() call will return a string like	
### ORM and DB
* what's the best practice when designing model.py ?

	implement __str__ and get_absolute_url
* what is hyperliked relationship
* when do we need to migrate again?
* what should be always added to models.py ?
	> “ In short, you should add a get_absolute_url() and __str__() method to each model you write.”

### How to 
* how can we force a item assoicate with the creating user?
