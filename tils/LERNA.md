	```
	lerna version patch --yes
	lerna publish from-git --yes
	```
* what does lerna version do ?

	* tag git history
	* incre sub package version
	* update all links to the sub package to latest version

* what does lerna publish do ?


	it does what lerna version does, plus
	* publish to npm

* whey need to seperate lerna version and publish ?

> Versioning is separated from publishing because I donâ€™t execute the two commands in the same location. For example, ==I can run lerna version manually, when I feel confident that my package deserves a new release==, and automate lerna publish remotely on a CI/CD platform, when all the checks and tests successfully pass and once a new version has been detected.


* how to make lerna publish ignore certain folder?

	in the package.json
	```json
	"private": true
	```

* how to change the lerna version commit messge ?

```
{
  "packages": [
    "packages/*"
  ],
  "version": "0.0.4",
  "command": {
    "version": {
      "message": "chore(release): publish"
    }
  }
}

```

* what's the function of yarn workspace ?

* How to init a new repo using lerana
