	* Queries

		Queries are one of the most powerful features in Roam. But some people find them too complicated to get to grips with. We will provide a simple guide to queries and show you how to quickly start using them.

	* Using blocks creatively
		Blocks are at the heart of what Roam is about. But some users don’t feel they get the point of them yet. We will provide a simple guide to blocks and show you all the new possibilities that the recent improvement to blocks open up.
	* Repository of text templates
		
		There was a lot of interest in the lesson on text templates. My next step is to set up a repository of text templates with examples for all the different ways they are used eg.:

		Checklists.
		Metadata templates for books, articles and videos.
		Writing/journal prompts.
		Decision-making templates.
