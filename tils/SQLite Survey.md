### sql concepts and tutorial

* good one with sample db [Introduction to Sqlite | IVYMobility TechBytes](https://medium.com/ivymobility-developers/mastering-in-sqlite-introduction-50fabfe59415)

* [SQLite views, triggers, transactions](https://zetcode.com/db/sqlite/viewstriggerstransactions/)
	good explaination
	
	views => ==similar to vds== read only table

### sqlite ETL

* skim [Turbocharging ETL jobs with SQLite and Nodejs! | by Frank Baele | The Startup | Medium](https://medium.com/swlh/turbocharging-etl-jobs-with-sqlite-and-nodejs-ae66b049083)

	> Another challenge is doing fast aggregations on our data set, again SQLite got us covered. SQLite has build-in aggregation functions or allows us to write our custom functions.


* study the process [Using SQLite in my ETL processes is something I have done for over a decade. It... | Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22153447)

	> The input data is loaded into the appropriate tables and then indexed as appropriate (or if appropriate). It is as "raw" as I can get it.
		Each successive transformation occurs on a new table. This is so I can always go back one step for any post-mortem if I need to. Also, I can reference something that might be DELETEd in an a later table.
	> I am not a very talented programmer so I stick very close to what is common, standard, and easy to understand. It usually means I am on the downslope of the hype cycle and it limits some opportunities but I have become okay with that.
	> ==They are The Definitive Guide to SQLite by Mike Owens and Using SQLite by Jay A. Kreibich. I am quite sure they are more book than I needed, I only plumbed a fraction of SQLite's immense capabilities.

select json_extract('{"a":2,"c":[4,5,{"f":7}]}', '$.a') as test
