# How much do I water my succulent?

## general rule of thumb of watering

 This is probably the number one question we get at the shop. And for good reason. Your succulent's life hinges on how much water you give it. Though the answer to this question varies depending on several variables (which we will go into later on!), the general rule of thumb is that you never want your succulent to stand in water. When your succulent stands in water, it dies. A succulent can come back from under-watering, but over-watering leads to a succulent's demise. You may think we are being dramatic, but c'mon, succulent death is kind of a big deal. So the short answer to the question of how much to water a succulent is: water it, but not so much that it's left standing in water.

 ## It's not water you need to worry about, it's rot

 ## So it's OK to not water succulents?
 No! Just because succulents can live off their leaves doesn't mean they won't die without water. Succulents simply last longer without it than other plants. Succulents do appreciate water and look best if given it regularly...up to a point.
In their native habitats, succulents look truly ratty during times of drought. And in nature or in your garden, succulents that are not well established or go too long without water may not survive.
They love nothing so much as rainwater. On the other hand, succulents dislike nothing so much as being cold and wet.

# How Much and How Often to Water Succulents


 ## How often should I water my succulent?
 You should water your succulents every other week during non-winter months when temperatures are above 40 degrees. During the winter time (when temperatures are below 40 degrees) you should only water your succulent once a month because it is dormant during this time.
There are a few exceptions to this rule. Certain types of succulents require more frequent watering because their leaves are teeny tiny and can't hold as much water compared to other varieties with plump leaves. For these tiny leaf succulents, feel free to give them a drink up to once a week in the non-winter months if they look thirsty. Succulents typically look a little wrinkly when they are thirsty. Remember though, it's always better to under-water than to over-water.
