Cannot write: No space left on device 
df

/dev/xvda1      7.7G  7.6G  165M  98% /

It is on a simple ssh EC2 server with literally nothing installed.

after some googling, I found what's the taking up the space - Linux Headers

HOW TO RESOLVE IT
sudo apt-get clean # this is to clean up some room, to execute the next command

sudo apt autoremove
HOW TO VERIFY
ubuntu@ip-172-31-24-72:~$ df -h
