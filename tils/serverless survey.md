# [integration s3 with lambda](https://www.lambdatv.com/integrating-s3-with-lambda)

* Things to keep in mind
S3 sends event directly to 1 target. Use the other integrations (SNS or SQS) to run multiple functions or even have one function that fans out to other functions.

* Events are not fired for failed operations. So if an upload to S3 failed, the trigger won‚Äôt occur.

* There are certain rules to follow while filtering for objects, e.g you can‚Äôt have overlapping filtering rules targeting different functions on a bucket. Check the documentation for the rules.

* Beware of recursion! If your target function creates a file in the same bucket, then this file will trigger the function again which will cause an infinite loop (and a huge AWS bill!)


# [Serverless: A lesson learned. The hard way](https://sourcebox.be/blog/2017/08/07/serverless-a-lesson-learned-the-hard-way/)

* be very careful with event trigger lambda, if recursive it could become very costly


# [Using SQS with AWS Lambda and Serverless](https://serverless.com/blog/aws-lambda-sqs-serverless-integration/)

* 3 ways to trigger lambda
    * api gateway
    * s3 triggers
    * sqs trigger
* good sqs design to plan for resilency
    * idempotent
    * batchsize should be set to one
    * Calling the DeleteMessage API manually within your function after successfully processing a message.
* concurrency control
```

# serverless.yml

functions:
hello:
handler: handler.hello
reservedConcurrency: 10 <-- Concurrency control
events: # Provide the ARN of your queue - sqs: arn:aws:sqs:us-east-1:123456789012:queue1

```

    sls deploy --function processSq --aws-s3-accelerate


* sls logs -f myFuncName -t
