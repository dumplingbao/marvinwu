* How to enable lambda to send sns in a private VPC using interface endpoint ?

VPC -> Endpoints -> create endpoint

![[Pasted image 20210706163914.png]]

choose the service and attach to the vpc, thats it.

	> But even a single endpoint like this can be a pain if youâ€™re using a service like Amazon CloudWatch Metrics to store metrics about your functionâ€™s execution. ==Like other AWS services, the CloudWatch Metrics API is a public API that requires public internet access== to publish metric data from your Lambda function.
	> Use tools like CloudWatch Metricâ€™s Embedded Metric Format or Lambda Destinations to interact with services

	* > Give your Lambda function public internet access with a NAT Gateway

	why need nat gateway ? can't use igw and public ip ?

	* > Create a VPC endpoint for your desired service
	
		> The second approach to using AWS services from a Lambda in a VPC is to set up a VPC endpoint in your VPC. VPC endpoints allow communication with AWS services from your VPC without requiring access to the public internet. Traffic to the configured service will be routed through the endpoint directly to the service without hitting the public internet.

		> There are two types of VPC endpoints: interface endpoints and gateway endpoints. 

		* > Gateway endpoints are simply a route in your subnetâ€™s route table that directs traffic directly to the given service. Gateway endpoints are great because they donâ€™t cost you anything to run. Unfortunately, ==gateway endpoints are only supported for Amazon S3 and DynamoDB==. If you want other services, youâ€™re out of luck.

		* > Interface endpoints support a much broader menu of services, including Amazon CloudWatch, Amazon SNS, Amazon SQS, and Amazon Kinesis. Interface endpoints use AWS PrivateLink to route your network traffic to the given service. Unfortunately,==interface endpoints do have an associated cost== â€” $0.01 per hour per endpoint per AZ (~$7.50 per month)
			[[Serverless and Lambdas]] ref: https://github.com/alexdebrie/serverless-vpc-examples/tree/master/vpc-endpoint

			The ==PrivateDnsEnabled property configures private DNS in our VPC for the public DNS name to route to the private IP addresses for the service==. In our situation, this means sns.us-east-1.amazonaws.com will route to our VPC endpoint.

	* > Service-specific ways of communication within a VPC

		* > Using the Embedded Metric Format to log metrics to CloudWatch
		* > Using Lambda Destinations to send payloads to SQS, SNS, or EventBridge.

			> With Lambda functions, you often are transforming and enriching some data, then sending it into another system like SQS, SNS, or EventBridge for processing. This process involves adding the AWS SDK into your Lambda function package, calling the proper service, and handling failure scenarios.
			
			> There are some limitations around Lambda Destinations â€” 
				* > they only work for asynchronous invocations, 
				* you can only send to a few AWS services, 
				* and it can only be used with messages that are sent at the end of your function invocation. Further, the wonderful crew at Trek10 has written up some surprising edges around Lambda Destinations.

	good detailed walk throught to add Nat gateway to VPC


	> If a VPC doesn't have an Internet Gateway, then the resources cannot be accessed from the Internet. Conversely, resources within your VPC need an Internet Gateway to access the Internet.

	* create two subnet
	* create internet gateway
	* attach IGW to VPC
	* create NAT gateway

		 * Choose the subnet you want to be public
		 * 
		 
	*
	* create new EIP
	![[Pasted image 20210706110331.png]]
	* add routes to routing table

	connectivity - choose public

> Note: ==Whether a subnet is private or public depends on its route table. A public subnet has a route pointing to an internet gateway, and a private subnet does not.==

> ==To grant internet access to your function, its associated VPC must have a NAT gateway (or NAT instance) in a public subnet.==
