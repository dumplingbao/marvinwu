	> 	1. Constraint Discovery & Verification
			a bit like unit tests for data
			â€¢ can cover inputs, outputs and intermediate results
			â€¢ automatically discovered
			â€¢ more-or-less including regular expressions for
			characterising strings (Rexpy)
			â€¢ Use as part of analysis to verify inputs, outputs and
			intermediates (as appropriate)

	> the TDDA Python module provides command-line and Python API support for the overall process of data analysis, through the following tools:
	> ==Reference Testing: ==extensions to unittest and pytest for managing testing of data analysis pipelines, where the results are typically much larger, and more complex, than single numerical values.
	> ==Constraints:== tools (and API) for discovery of constraints from data, for validation of constraints on new data, and for anomaly detection.
	> ==Finding Regular Expressions: ==tools (and API) for automatically inferring regular expressions from text data.

	> TDD generates a conflict due to the code having to have external dependencies. One of the biggest problems with testing a data project's functions is that they depend on the data they are running or an external system.

	> that when working with real data, there are two moving parts: the data (and its quality) and your cod
