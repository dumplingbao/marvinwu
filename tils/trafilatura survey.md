	 > Trafilatura supports two different ways to gather further links ==web feeds (Atom and RSS)== or ==sitemaps==. As a result, a comprehensive overview of the available documents can be obtained faster and more efficiently than by systematically extracting and following links within a website.

	```
	# run link discovery through a sitemap for sitemaps.org and store the resulting links in a file
	$ trafilatura --sitemap "https://www.sitemaps.org/" --list > mylinks.txt
	# using an already known sitemap URL
	$ trafilatura --sitemap "https://www.sitemaps.org/sitemap.xml" --list
	# targeting webpages in German
	$ trafilatura --sitemap "https://www.sitemaps.org/" --list --target-language "de"
	```

	download txt to stsructure data
	
	```
	trafilatura --xml -i links.txt -o xmlfiles
	
	```
	
	tokenize
	
	```
	$ somajo-tokenizer --xml xmlfiles/filename.xml

> Compared with HTML

> XML is extensible: it does not consist of a fixed set of tags;
> XML documents must be well-formed according to a defined syntax;
an XML document can be formally validated against a set of schema rules for consistent application;
* XML is more interested in the ==meaning of data than in its presentation==.
